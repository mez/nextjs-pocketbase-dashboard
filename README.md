## Next.js App Router Course With Pocketbase! - Final

This is the final template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the final code for the dashboard application. Pocketbase was used for all the database + auth related tasks.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

I was inspired to do this with pocketbase to give any new user of NextJS that happens to also be using [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) a sorts of reference.


### If you want to get this working....
Just follow along with the course and then reference this repo for the database interaction to see how I did it using pocketbase. Some working knowledge of how pocketbase stores records and collections is required. Pocketbase is so awesome and hope you find this repo useful! 

### Pocketbase Schema and Seed Data 

Check out the `/pb-seed` and you'll find the collections schema I exported. Including a backup of the database. You can just use these
to seed your database!

### If you find an issue or have a suggestion for better coding practice!?!?

Please create an issue here so that we can all learn!
